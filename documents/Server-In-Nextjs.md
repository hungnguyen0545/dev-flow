# Server in Next.js: What is the Server and Where Is It Stored?

## ✅ What is the "Server" in Next.js?

In a **Next.js app**, the **server** refers to the backend runtime environment that:

- Processes server-side logic (e.g., database queries, authentication)
- Renders React components on the server before sending HTML to the browser
- Executes APIs, Server Components, and **Server Actions**

### 📌 It could be one of the following environments:

| Environment               | Description                                                                   |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Vercel Edge Functions** | Lightweight, distributed "serverless" runtimes close to the user              |
| **Node.js server**        | Traditional backend environment when self-hosting or using custom servers     |
| **Serverless Functions**  | Auto-scaled functions (e.g., AWS Lambda, Vercel Functions, Netlify Functions) |

---

## 📦 Where Is "Server" Code Stored?

Server-side code (including Server Actions) is part of your source code. When deployed, it is:

- **Bundled and uploaded** to the cloud (e.g., Vercel, AWS)
- Executed in **Edge Functions**, **Serverless Functions**, or your own **Node.js process**

Examples:

- On **Vercel**, Server Actions are deployed as **Edge or Serverless Functions**
- On **a VPS**, they run in your **Node.js server process**

---

## 📥 So Where Does a Server Action Run?

Example Server Action:

```ts
"use server";

export async function saveUser(formData) {
  await db.users.create({ name: formData.get("name") });
}
```

This function:

- **Does not run in the browser**
- Is **only executed in a secure server environment**
- Is deployed and runs **where your app backend is hosted**

---

## 🔐 Why This Matters

Server Actions allow you to:

- Access secrets (DB credentials, API keys)
- Perform secure mutations
- Avoid exposing logic to the client
- Eliminate the need to create separate API routes like `/api/xyz`

## 🧠 Simple Architecture

| Layer         | Example                | Runs Where?               |
| ------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Client        | Button, Form, JSX      | In the browser            |
| Server Action | `saveUser(formData)`   | Backend (Node.js or Edge) |
| Database      | `db.users.create(...)` | Database server           |

---

## 🚀 Example on Vercel

- You push code to GitHub → Vercel builds the app
- Server Actions get deployed as **serverless functions**
- When invoked, the function runs in a secure Vercel runtime

---

## 🔚 TL;DR

> In Next.js, **"server" means the secure backend runtime (Node.js or serverless)** where sensitive logic is executed. Server Actions are stored in your codebase and **deployed to run in that secure environment — not in the browser.**
