- HTTP is a `stateless protocol`, meaning it `does not maintain state between requests`. However, web applications often require maintaining state to manage user sessions, track user preferences, and personalize user experiences.

- To address this, various state management mechanisms have been developed, including cookies, local storage, session storage, and more.
