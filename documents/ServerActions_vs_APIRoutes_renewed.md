# Server Actions vs API Routes in Next.js

A practical comparison table designed for real-world decision-making in modern Next.js projects.

## ‚úÖ Comparison Table

| Aspect | **Server Actions** | **API Routes** | **Example** |
|--------|--------------------|----------------|-------------|
| **Framework Integration** | Built-in with App Router and React Server Components | Standalone, works with any frontend | Use `submitForm()` directly in a React component vs calling `/api/submit` |
| **Trigger Method** | Auto-handled by form or event (`'use server'` functions) | Manual HTTP (GET/POST/etc.) via `fetch()` | `<form action={submit}>` vs `fetch('/api/submit', { method: 'POST' })` |
| **Parsing Request** | Auto-parses form data | Manual parsing (`req.body`, method check) | `formData.get('name')` vs `JSON.parse(req.body)` |
| **Client Usage** | Called directly in JSX or forms | Called via `fetch()` from client or hook | `const action = await updateProfile(data)` vs `axios.post('/api/profile')` |
| **Error Handling** | Handled via React error boundaries | You handle errors on both server and client | `throw new Error('Invalid')` shows UI fallback vs `.catch()` and `res.status(500)` |
| **Type Safety** | End-to-end TypeScript, types are shared | Types are separate on client and server | Reuse `UserType` in both client & server vs manually sync `ResponseType` |
| **Caching / SSG** | Works well with static & dynamic rendering | Always dynamic unless manually cached | Server Action can trigger static revalidation vs set headers manually |
| **Progressive Enhancement** | Works without JavaScript (native forms) | Requires JS to `fetch()` | Form with `action={serverAction}` still submits on no-JS browsers |
| **External API Use** | ‚ùå Not designed for external access | ‚úÖ Good for public API consumption | Internal-only form handler vs public `/api/products` endpoint |
| **Performance** | Lightweight for simple mutations | Better for heavy or isolated logic | Update button uses Server Action instantly vs route that processes logs |
| **Streaming Support** | Supports React Suspense, partial rendering | No native support, must implement manually | Show partial UI immediately while waiting for server |
| **Best Use Case** | Internal form handling and fast UI mutations | Public APIs, integration points, complex server logic | Handle `likePost` in Server Action vs expose `/api/order-status` for mobile app |

## üîö When to Use Each

| Use Case | Recommended Approach |
|----------|----------------------|
| Simple form submission (e.g. contact form) | ‚úÖ Server Action |
| Need API for mobile app or 3rd party | ‚úÖ API Route |
| Reuse types & logic across client and server | ‚úÖ Server Action |
| Custom HTTP behavior (headers, auth) | ‚úÖ API Route |
| Progressive enhancement, no JS support | ‚úÖ Server Action |
| Large, decoupled business logic | ‚úÖ API Route |
